# UCBAIML_M5
Repository for UCB AI ML Module 5 Assignment - Coupon Accepted
This readme file provides some details on the different types of data explorations I did with the coupons data set and my observations
In order to make the data set usable I have filled null values of the following columns  ['Bar','RestaurantLessThan20','CarryAway','Restaurant20To50','CoffeeHouse'] with never.  The assumption I have made if the column value for the following is null that means the customer never visited them.  

Following are my observations based on the analysis and visualization of the dataset for coupons
1.  56% of the folks who received a coupon accepted it
2.  Coffee House is the highest accepted coupon followed by restuarant (< 20)
3.  College drop outs or some degree and bachelors degree are the highest that accepted coupons
4.  Folks in the age groups of 21, 26 and 31 were the most that accepted the coupons
